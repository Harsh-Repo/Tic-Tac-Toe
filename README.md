# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game: A Classic Reinvented! 🌟

Welcome to our Tic-Tac-Toe game, a timeless classic that's been given a digital twist! This project is more than just a simple implementation of the well-loved game; it's a vibrant and interactive experience that brings together the charm of the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe with modern web technologies.

## What's the Game About? 🤔

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a strategy game for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to mark a square with their symbol (either 'X' or 'O'). The first player to align three of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game! 🎉

But it's not just about winning or losing; it's about strategy, thinking ahead, and sometimes, a bit of luck. Will you be able to outmaneuver your opponent and claim victory?

## Features of Our Game 🚀

## Under the Hood 🛠️

This project is not just about playing; it's about learning and exploring how a simple game can be brought to life using web technologies. We dive deep into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create an experience that's both fun to play and insightful to understand.

So, whether you're here to enjoy a quick game or to delve into the coding aspects, there's something for everyone!

## `main.js` - Orchestrating the Game 🎼

The `main.js` file is where the various components of our Tic-Tac-Toe game come together. It's responsible for initiating the game and managing the interactions between the player and the game logic.

### The Role of `main.js`(./main.js) 🎬

- **Kickstarts the Game:** When you load the game, `main.js` is the first script that runs, setting everything in motion.
- **Listens to Your Moves:** Every click you make on the game board is captured here, determining the flow of the game.
- **Decides the Outcome:** It calls upon the game logic to decide if a move is a winning move, a draw, or just another step in the game.
- **Celebrates Your Victory:** If you win, `main.js` triggers the celebratory effects to make your victory even sweeter.

### Core Functions 🧠

- `handleCellClick`: Called when a cell on the game board is clicked, this function plays your move and checks for the game's outcome.
- `restartGame`: Resets the game to the beginning state, ready for a new challenge.

### Event Listeners 👂

`main.js` sets up listeners for user actions like clicking a cell or pressing the restart button, making the game interactive and responsive.

### Initialization 🌱

Lastly, `main.js` ensures that the game board is enabled and ready for play, making sure that as soon as you're ready to play, the game is too.

Simply put, `main.js` is the conductor of the orchestra, ensuring that each part of the game performs in harmony to give you an enjoyable gaming experience.

## 🧠 `gameLogic.js` - The Brain of the Game

By orchestrating the rules, the turns, and the outcomes, `gameLogic.js` ensures that the game remains fair, engaging, and thrilling with every move you make.

## 🖥️ `uiInteractions.js` - User Interface Dynamics

The `uiInteractions.js` file is the conduit between the game logic and the player's eyes. This script is responsible for the visual aspects that players interact with, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

### Visual Feedback and Interaction 🎨
